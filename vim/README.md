## what do I use for a base

https://github.com/amix/vimrc#install-for-your-own-user-only

## adding plugins

this base use pathogen to manage plugins, the default folder adding plugins

`~/.vim_runtime/my_plugins`

after you `git clone` the plugins into that folder, it will be automatically enabled by pathogen

## current plugins added

* [jedi-vim](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim)
* [indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine#installation)

## the customization

all the customization would be in `my_configs.vim` file under `~/.vim_runtime/`, including overwrite, deletion or addition.
